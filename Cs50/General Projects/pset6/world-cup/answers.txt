Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I predicted that since sweden and urugway have the same odds of winnin at N=10, by N=100000 they would separate out, but they did not

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would start a betting company, and run the simulations as many times as needed so that I wouldn't hurt my profit margins.
